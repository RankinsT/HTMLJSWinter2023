                    I loved <em>Pacific Rim</em> for its action and its intention to be realistic in the department of giant, towering, pilotable mechs. The power that the Jeagers were shown to have <br>
                    alongside their realistic slow movement enraptured me while watching the movie. In addition to its action and as much realism you could have with giant robots and giant monsters, I loved <br>
                    <em>Pacific Rim's</em> sound design presented for the towering mechs and Collosal Kaiju's throughout the movie. I'd say my favorite Jeager from the movie would either be <br>
                    Cherno Alpha, because of its simple yet devastating design. Or I would also choose Crimson Typhoon for its creative and well visualized "Thundercloud" formation with three pilots instead of the normal two.

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>According to one of the actors in the movie, the sets made while filming were very unique and extremely detailed. <br>So much so that if you looked into a car on set, it would have a receipt from a store that exists in the movie.</li>
                    <li>The sounds from the Kaiju were made with animal roars and growls with a touch of human samples that were filtered, sped up, and slowed down.</li>
                    <li>del Toro, the director, stated that over 200 Jeagers and Kaiju were designed while only a dozen or so made an appearance in the movie.</li>
